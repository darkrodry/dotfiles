# DarkRodry dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. Enjoy it!

My dotfiles use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) to automatize the installation process.

## Install

To install this dotfiles, clone the repository and execute `./install`.

The script will create symlink for all the dotfiles to the repository, install some applications and configure the system. If you update the repository you could also update the dotfiles running the script again.

## Thanks
